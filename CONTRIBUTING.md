# Introduction

Thank you for considering to contribute to organisation-registry.

# Getting started

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in a branch of your fork.
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Run `build.sh` to make sure everything still compiles and all tests are still passing.
    * Be sure your commits follow the style for the project. You can run `npm run commit` to use [commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/#integrating-with-pre-commit), which standardises our commit messages. 
    * Send a pull request.
